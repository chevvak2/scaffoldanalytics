    all R-groups associated with the scaffold \\
    ScaffoldScore & A quantitative assessment of the scaffold quality.
    See Section \ref{sec:scaffold-metrics} \\
    Complexity & A number that captures increasing size and complexity of
    scaffolds. See Section \ref{sec:scaffold-metrics}.  \\

    correspond to aggregated property columns. Thus for each
    property of the input molecules, we compute the mean and standard
    deviation of that property for all molecules containing the
    scaffold. These values are reported in columns labeled \texttt{X} and
    \texttt{$X_{sd}$}, where \texttt{X} is the property name.}

  MolID & Numeric or text molecule identifier (name). Each molecule is
  repeated once for each scaffold that it occurs in \\
  Structure & Molecule structure in SMILES format \\
  $R_1, \ldots, R_n$ & R-group SMILES, with \*-atoms at attachment
  points. By default we limit to $n = 21$ \\

\section{Scaffold metrics}
\label{sec:scaffold-metrics}

The NCATS R-group tool is designed to fragment a collection of
molecules. In addition to the fragmentation procedure it computes a
series of scaffold metrics, described in Table
\ref{table:scaffoldfilecolumns}. In this section we provide some
details about the \textit{ScaffoldScore} and \textit{Complexity}
metrics.

The \textit{ScaffoldScore} is an empirical metric designed to
summarize a scaffold (or more generally, a fragment) and the compounds
containing the scaffold. Specifically, we define it as  
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  S = -\log_{10} \Bigg( \sqrt{ N_{\mathrm{core}} \times \frac{N_{m}}{N} \times
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma}} \times \frac{1}{R} }  \, \Bigg)
\end{equation}
where $N_{\mathrm{core}}$ is the atom count of the scaffold,
$N_{m}$ is the size of the member set for the scaffold,
$N$ is the total number of molecules used as input, $R$ is the number
of R-groups identified for this scaffold and $\sigma$ is a measure of
how close the members are to the scaffold and is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \sigma = \sum_{i=1}^{N_m} ( A_i - N_{\mathrm{core}} )^2
\end{equation}
where $A_i$ is the atom count of the $i$'th molecule in the scaffolds
member set.  In summary, the score for a scaffold is higher if it is
larger, with fewer R-groups and with member molecules that are
relatively close to the scaffold and cover a large fraction of the
input set.

The \textit{Complexity} metric is an implemention of the empirical
complexity metric described by Barone and Channon \cite{Barone2001}.
\textit{Complexity} can be used to prune away scaffolds that are too
simple, by setting a cutoff such as 100.
