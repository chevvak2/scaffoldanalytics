   Abstract={Drug discovery projects often involve organizing compounds in the form of a hierarchical tree, where each node is a substructure fragment shared by all of its descendent nodes. A method is described for producing 2D depiction layout coordinates for each of the nodes in such a tree, ensuring that common fragments within molecular structures are drawn in an identical way, and arranged with a consistent orientation. This is achieved by first deriving a common numbering scheme for common fragments, then using this scheme to redepict each of the molecules, one fragment at a time, so that common fragments have common depiction motifs. Once complete, the distinct root branches can be overlaid onto each other, after which all of the fragments and whole molecules have a common layout and orientation. Several methods are described for preparing visual representations of molecular structure hierarchies alongside activity information. Combining high level tree display and structure depiction showing common features readily facilitates insight into structure-activity relationships.},

   Abstract={A method is presented for the detection and analysis of multiple common scaffolds for small collections of pharmaceutically relevant molecules that share a set of common structural motifs. The input consists of the molecules themselves, possibly some of the scaffolds, and possibly information about the relation between the substitution points of these scaffolds. Three new algorithms are presented: multiple scaffold detection, common scaffold alignment, and scaffold substructure assignment. Each of these steps is relevant for cases when either none, some, or all information about the common scaffolds and their substitution patterns is available. Each of these problems must be solved in an optimal way in order to produce useful structure-activity correlations. The output consists of a collection of scaffolds, a common numbering system, and a unique mapping of each molecule to a single scaffold substructure. This information can then be used to produce data for structure-activity analysis of medicinal chemistry project databases.},

   Abstract={Compounds known to be potent against a specific protein target may potentially contain a signature profile of common substructures that is highly correlated to their potency. These substructure profiles may be useful in enriching compound libraries or for prioritizing compounds against a specific protein target. With this objective in mind, a set of compounds with known potency against six selected kinases (2 each from 3 kinase families) was used to generate binary molecular fingerprints. Each fingerprint key represents a substructure that is found within a compound and the frequency with which the fingerprint occurs was then tabulated. Thereafter, a frequent pattern mining technique was applied with the aim of uncovering substructures that are not only well represented among known potent inhibitors but are also unrepresented among known inactive compounds and vice versa. Substructure profiles that are representative of potent inhibitors against each of the 3 kinase families were thus extracted. Based on our validation results, these substructure profiles demonstrated significant enrichment for highly potent compounds against their respective kinase targets. The advantages of using our approach over conventional methods in analyzing such datasets and its application in the mining of substructures for enriching compound libraries are presented.},

Standard statistical and classification techniques can be used to organize data sets and evaluate the chemical neighborhood of potent hits; however, such methods are limited in their ability to extract complex SAR patterns from data sets and make them readily accessible to medicinal chemists. Therefore, new approaches and data structures are being developed that explicitly focus on molecular structure and its relationship to biological activity across multiple targets. Here, we review standard techniques for compound data analysis and describe new data structures and computational tools for SAR mining of large compound data sets.},

   Abstract={The transfer of SAR information from one analog series to another is a difficult, yet highly attractive task in medicinal chemistry. At present, the evaluation of SAR transfer potential from a data mining perspective is still in its infancy. Only recently, a first computational approach has been introduced to evaluate SAR transfer events. Here, a substructure relationship-based molecular network representation has been used as a starting point to systematically identify SAR transfer series in large compound data sets. For this purpose, a methodology is introduced that consists of two stages. For graph mining, an algorithm has been designed that extracts all parallel series from compound data sets. A parallel series is formed by two series of analogs with different core structures but pairwise corresponding substitution patterns. The SAR transfer potential of identified parallel series is then evaluated using a scoring function that emphasizes corresponding potency progression over many analog pairs and large potency ranges. The substructure relationship-based molecular network in combination with the graph mining algorithm currently represents the only generally applicable approach to systematically detect SAR transfer events in large compound data sets. The combined approach has been evaluated on a large number of compound data sets and shown to systematically identify SAR transfer series.},

   Abstract={It is well appreciated that the results of ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) are much influenced by methodological details, given the generally strong compound class dependence of LBVS methods. It is less well understood to what extent structure-activity relationship (SAR) characteristics might influence the outcome of LBVS. We have assessed the hypothesis that the success of prospective LBVS depends on the SAR tolerance of screening targets, in addition to methodological aspects. In this context, SAR tolerance is rationalized as the ability of a target protein to specifically interact with series of structurally diverse active compounds. In compound data sets, SAR tolerance articulates itself as SAR continuity, i.e., the presence of structurally diverse compounds having similar potency. In order to analyze the role of SAR tolerance for LBVS, activity landscape representations of compounds active against 16 different target proteins were generated for which successful LBVS applications were reported. In all instances, the activity landscapes of known active compounds contained multiple regions of local SAR continuity. When analyzing the location of newly identified LBVS hits and their SAR environments, we found that these hits almost exclusively mapped to regions of distinct local SAR continuity. Taken together, these findings indicate the presence of a close link between SAR tolerance at the target level, SAR continuity at the ligand level, and the probability of LBVS success.},

SAR pathways are systematically identified consisting of sequences of similar active compounds with gradual increases in potency.

High-scoring SAR pathways often reveal activity cliffs contained in screening data.

Here, we introduce an approach that combines the analysis of similarity-based molecular networks and SAR index distributions to identify multiple SAR components present within sets of active compounds. Different compound classes produce molecular networks of distinct topology. Subsets of compounds related by different local SARs are often organized in small communities in networks annotated with potency information. Many local SAR communities are not isolated but connected by chemical bridges, i.e., similar molecules occurring in different local SAR contexts. The analysis makes it possible to relate local and global SAR features to each other and identify key compounds that are major determinants of SAR characteristics. In many instances, such compounds represent start and end points of chemical optimization pathways and aid in the selection of other candidates from their communities.},

   Abstract={In high-throughput screens (HTS) of small molecules for activity in an in vitro assay, it is common to search for active scaffolds, with at least one example successfully confirmed as an active. The number of active scaffolds better reflects the success of the screen than the number of active molecules. Many existing algorithms for deciding which hits should be sent for confirmatory testing neglect this concern.\\ We derived a new extension of a recently proposed economic framework, diversity-oriented prioritization (DOP), that aims-by changing which hits are sent for confirmatory testing-to maximize the number of scaffolds with at least one confirmed active. In both retrospective and prospective experiments, DOP accurately predicted the number of scaffold discoveries in a batch of confirmatory experiments, improved the rate of scaffold discovery by 8-17\%, and was surprisingly robust to the size of the confirmatory test batches. As an extension of our previously reported economic framework, DOP can be used to decide the optimal number of hits to send for confirmatory testing by iteratively computing the cost of discovering an additional scaffold, the marginal cost of discovery.\\ swamidass@wustl.edu\\ Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

   Abstract={The Scaffold Tree algorithm (J Chem Inf Model 47:47-58, 2007) allows to organize large molecular data sets by arranging sets of molecules into a unique tree hierarchy based on their scaffolds, with scaffolds forming leaf nodes of such tree. The hierarchy is created by iterative removal of rings from more complex scaffolds using chemically meaningful set of rules, until a single, root ring is obtained. The classification is deterministic, data set independent, and scales linearly with the number of compounds included in the data set. In this review we summarize the basic principles of the Scaffold Tree methodology and review its applications, which appeared in recent medicinal chemistry literature, including the use of Scaffold Trees for visualization of large chemical data sets, compound clustering, and the identification of novel bioactive molecules. References to several computer programs, including also free tools available on the Internet, allowing to perform classification and visualization of molecules based on their scaffolds are also provided.}

   Abstract={From a medicinal chemistry point of view, one of the primary goals of high throughput screening (HTS) hit list assessment is the identification of chemotypes with an informative structure-activity relationship (SAR). Such chemotypes may enable optimization of the primary potency, as well as selectivity and phamacokinetic properties. A common way to prioritize them is molecular clustering of the hits. Typical clustering techniques, however, rely on a general notion of chemical similarity or standard rules of scaffold decomposition and are thus insensitive to molecular features that are enriched in biologically active compounds. This hinders SAR analysis, because compounds sharing the same pharmacophore might not end up in the same cluster and thus are not directly compared to each other by the medicinal chemist. Similarly, common chemotypes that are not related to activity may contaminate clusters, distracting from important chemical motifs. We combined molecular similarity and Bayesian models and introduce (I) a robust, activity-aware clustering approach and (II) a feature mapping method for the elucidation of distinct SAR determinants in polypharmacologic compounds. We evaluated the method on 462 dose-response assays from the Pubchem Bioassay repository. Activity-aware clustering grouped compounds sharing molecular cores that were specific for the target or pathway at hand, rather than grouping inactive scaffolds commonly found in compound series. Many of these core structures we also found in literature that discussed SARs of the respective targets. A numerical comparison of cores allowed for identification of the structural prerequisites for polypharmacology, i.e., distinct bioactive regions within a single compound, and pointed toward selectivity-conferring medchem strategies. The method presented here is generally applicable to any type of activity data and may help bridge the gap between hit list assessment and designing a medchem strategy.},

   Abstract={The four-parameter logistic Hill equation models the theoretical relationship between inhibitor concentration and response and is used to derive IC(50) values as a measure of compound potency. This relationship is the basis for screening strategies that first measure percent inhibition at a single, uniform concentration and then determine IC(50) values for compounds above a threshold. In screening practice, however, a "good" correlation between percent inhibition values and IC(50) values is not always observed, and in the literature, there seems confusion about what correlation even to expect. We examined the relationship between percent inhibition data and IC(50) data in HDAC4 and ENPP2 high-throughput screening (HTS) data sets and compared our findings with a series of numerical simulations that allowed the investigation of the influence of parameters representing different types of uncertainties: variability in the screening concentration (related to solution library and compound characteristics, liquid handling), variations in Hill model parameters (related to interaction of compounds with target, type of assay), and influences of assay data quality parameters (related to assay and experimental design, liquid handling). In the different sensitivity analyses, we found that the typical variations of the actual compound concentrations in existing screening libraries generate the largest contributions to imperfect correlations. Excess variability in the ENPP2 assay above the values of the simulation model can be explained by compound aggregation artifacts.},

This report describes how this method can be used to identify such hit series, even when no hits according to conventional hit-calling methods for a given structural class are present in the data set. Such series, which were called latent hit series, were identified prospectively in a cell-based screening campaign and also in a series of retrospective analyses of publicly available data sets from PubChem. The assay used for the prospective case study was developed to identify compounds modulating protein translation directed from the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) genomic RNA. The assay was designed with the ability to detect two assay readouts. The first assay readout monitors compound effects on IRES-directed translation, and the second readout monitors the cell viability and general effect on protein expression. By applying CSE separately to both of them, six validated latent hit series with apparently no effects on cell viability were identified. For each of these series, further testing of new compounds enabled identification of additional hits, also apparently with no effect on cell viability. These validated latent hit series would have been missed by a conventional cutoff-based hit-calling approach. This prospective study further supports CSE as a method for the analysis of high-throughput screening experiments.},

   Abstract={Identification of meaningful chemical patterns in the increasing amounts of high-throughput-generated bioactivity data available today is an increasingly important challenge for successful drug discovery. Herein, we present the scaffold network as a novel approach for mapping and navigation of chemical and biological space. A scaffold network represents the chemical space of a library of molecules consisting of all molecular scaffolds and smaller "parent" scaffolds generated therefrom by the pruning of rings, effectively leading to a network of common scaffold substructure relationships. This algorithm provides an extension of the scaffold tree algorithm that, instead of a network, generates a tree relationship between a heuristically rule-based selected subset of parent scaffolds. The approach was evaluated for the identification of statistically significantly active scaffolds from primary screening data for which the scaffold tree approach has already been shown to be successful. Because of the exhaustive enumeration of smaller scaffolds and the full enumeration of relationships between them, about twice as many statistically significantly active scaffolds were identified compared to the scaffold-tree-based approach. We suggest visualizing scaffold networks as islands of active scaffolds.},

   Abstract={The Scaffold Tree algorithm (J Chem Inf Model 47:47-58, 2007) allows to organize large molecular data sets by arranging sets of molecules into a unique tree hierarchy based on their scaffolds, with scaffolds forming leaf nodes of such tree. The hierarchy is created by iterative removal of rings from more complex scaffolds using chemically meaningful set of rules, until a single, root ring is obtained. The classification is deterministic, data set independent, and scales linearly with the number of compounds included in the data set. In this review we summarize the basic principles of the Scaffold Tree methodology and review its applications, which appeared in recent medicinal chemistry literature, including the use of Scaffold Trees for visualization of large chemical data sets, compound clustering, and the identification of novel bioactive molecules. References to several computer programs, including also free tools available on the Internet, allowing to perform classification and visualization of molecules based on their scaffolds are also provided.}

In light of this goal, a new method (called compound set enrichment) to identify active chemical series from primary screening data is proposed. The method employs the scaffold tree compound classification in conjunction with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to assess the overall activity of a compound scaffold. The application of this method to seven PubChem data sets (containing between 9389 and 263679 molecules) is presented, and the ability of this method to identify compound classes with only weakly active compounds (potentially latent hits) is demonstrated. The analysis presented here shows how methods based on an activity cutoff can distort activity information, leading to the incorrect activity assignment of compound series. These results suggest that this method might have utility in the rational selection of active classes of compounds (and not just individual active compounds) for followup and validation.},

We demonstrate that scaffold trees built using bioactivity as the key selection criterion for structural simplification during tree construction allow efficient and intuitive mapping, visualization and navigation of the chemical space defined by a given library, which in turn allows correlation of this chemical space with the investigated bioactivity and further compound design. Brachiation along the branches of such trees from structurally complex to simple scaffolds with retained yet varying bioactivity is feasible at high frequency for the five major pharmaceutically relevant target classes and allows for the identification of new inhibitor types for a given target. We provide proof of principle by identifying new active scaffolds for 5-lipoxygenase and the estrogen receptor ERalpha.}

The molecular frameworks form the leaf nodes in the hierarchy trees. By an iterative removal of rings, scaffolds forming the higher levels in the hierarchy tree are obtained. Prioritization rules ensure that less characteristic, peripheral rings are removed first. All scaffolds in the hierarchy tree are well-defined chemical entities making the classification chemically intuitive. The classification is deterministic, data-set-independent, and scales linearly with the number of compounds included in the data set. The application of the classification is demonstrated on two data sets extracted from the PubChem database, namely, pyruvate kinase binders and a collection of pesticides.

SpeedScreen relies on the screening of compound mixtures with various target proteins and uses fast size-exclusion chromatography to separate target-bound from unbound substances. After disintegration of the target-binder complex, the binder molecules are identified by their molecular masses using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The authors report an analysis of the molecular properties of hits obtained with SpeedScreen on 26 targets screened within the past few years at Novartis using this technology. Affinity-based SpeedScreen is a robust high-throughput screening technology that does not accumulate frequent hitters or potential covalent binders. The hits are representative of the most commonly identified scaffold classes observed for known drugs. Validated SpeedScreen hits tend to be enriched on more lipophilic and larger-molecular-weight compounds compared to the whole library. The potential for a reduced SpeedScreen screening set to be used in case only limited protein quantities are available is evaluated. Such a reduced compound set should also maximize the coverage of the high-performing regions of the chemical property and class spaces; chemoinformatics methods including genetic algorithms and divisive K-means clustering are used for this aim.},

Here, we combine these two approaches and apply the algorithm RedFrag to virtual screens retrospectively and prospectively. It uses a new type of reduced graph that does not suffer from information loss during its construction and bypasses the necessity of feature definitions. Built upon chemical epitopes resulting from molecule fragmentation, the reduced graph embodies physico-chemical and 2D-structural properties of a molecule. Reduced graphs are compared with a continuous-similarity-distance-driven maximal common subgraph algorithm, which calculates similarity at the fragmental and topological levels. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by retrieval experiments utilizing precompiled validation sets. By predicting and experimentally testing ligands for endothiapepsin, a challenging model protease, the method is assessed in a prospective setting. Here, we identified five novel ligands with affinities as low as 2.08 uM.}

   Abstract={Similarity-based methods for virtual screening are widely used. However, conventional searching using 2D chemical fingerprints or 2D graphs may retrieve only compounds which are structurally very similar to the original target molecule. Of particular current interest then is scaffold hopping, that is, the ability to identify molecules that belong to different chemical series but which could form the same interactions with a receptor. Reduced graphs provide summary representations of chemical structures and, therefore, offer the potential to retrieve compounds that are similar in terms of their gross features rather than at the atom-bond level. Using only a fingerprint representation of such graphs, we have previously shown that actives retrieved were more diverse than those found using Daylight fingerprints. Maximum common substructures give an intuitively reasonable view of the similarity between two molecules. However, their calculation using graph-matching techniques is too time-consuming for use in practical similarity searching in larger data sets. In this work, we exploit the low cardinality of the reduced graph in graph-based similarity searching. We reinterpret the reduced graph as a fully connected graph using the bond-distance information of the original graph. We describe searches, using both the maximum common induced subgraph and maximum common edge subgraph formulations, on the fully connected reduced graphs and compare the results with those obtained using both conventional chemical and reduced graph fingerprints. We show that graph matching using fully connected reduced graphs is an effective retrieval method and that the actives retrieved are likely to be topologically different from those retrieved using conventional 2D methods.}

   Abstract={An extended reduced graph approach (ErG) is presented that uses pharmacophore-type node descriptions to encode the relevant molecular properties. The basic idea of the method can be described as a hybrid approach of reduced graphs (Gillet et al. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2003, 43, 338-345) and binding property pairs (Kearsley et al. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1996, 36, 118-127). However, specific extension modifications to correctly describe the pharmacophoric properties, size, and shape of the molecules under study result in a very stable and good performance as compared to DAYLIGHT fingerprints (DFP). This is exemplified for 11 activity classes of the MDL Drug Data Report database, for which ErG performs as well or better than DFP in 10 cases. On the basis of the example data sets, the ability of ErG to switch from one chemotype to another (often referred to as "scaffold hopping") is highlighted. Additionally, possible pitfalls of reduced graph approaches as well as suitable solutions are discussed with the help of example structures. Overall, it is shown that ErG is a widely applicable method capable of identifying structurally diverse actives for a given active search query. This diversity is achieved by a high degree of molecular abstraction, which in turn results in a low dimensional descriptor vector that allows very low computation times for similarity searches.}

   Abstract={A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is described for evolving multiple structure-activity relationships (SARs). The SARs are encoded in easy-to-interpret reduced graph queries which describe features that are preferentially present in active compounds compared to inactives. The MOEA addresses a limitation associated with many machine learning methods; that is, the inherent tradeoff that exists in recall and precision which is usually handled by combining the two objectives into a single measure with a consequent loss of control. By simultaneously optimizing recall and precision, the MOEA generates a family of SARs that lie on the precision-recall (PR) curve. The user is then able to select a query with an appropriate balance in the two objectives: for example, a low recall-high precision query may be preferred when establishing the SAR, whereas a high recall-low precision query may be more appropriate in a virtual screening context. Each query on the PR curve aims at capturing the structure-activity information into a single representation, and each can be considered as an alternative (equally valid) solution. We then investigate combining individual queries into teams with the aim of capturing multiple SARs that may exist in a data set, for example, as is commonly seen in high-throughput screening data sets. Team formation is carried out iteratively as a postprocessing step following the evolution of the individual queries. The inclusion of uniqueness as a third objective within the MOEA provides an effective way of ensuring the queries are complementary in the active compounds they describe. Substantial improvements in both recall and precision are seen for some data sets. Furthermore, the resulting queries provide more detailed structure-activity information than is present in a single query.}

The reduced graph representation enables heterogeneous compounds, such as those found in high-throughput screening data, to be captured in a single representation with the resulting query encoding structure-activity information in a form that is readily interpretable by a chemist. The application of the method is illustrated using data sets extracted from the well-known MDDR data set and GSK in-house screening data. Queries are evolved that are consistent with the known SARs, and they are also shown to be robust when applied to independent sets that were not used in training.}

The protocol described here employs the Molecular Equivalence Index tool to facilitate the selection of Bemis-Murcko frameworks in the data set, which contain at least five compounds and Scaffold Hunter to generate a hierarchical tree of scaffolds. The annotation of the scaffold tree with protein-binding profile data enabled the successful identification of mostly highly specific compounds, due to data set constraints. We also applied this approach to a public set of 1497 small molecules screened non-uniformly across a panel of 172 protein kinases.

The frequency of occurrence of multiple structural fragments in kinase inhibitor libraries relative to nonkinase compounds has been analyzed. A combination of structural fragment counts, termed the "2-0" kinase-likeness rule, provides approximately 5-fold enrichment in kinase active compounds. This rule has been validated using in-house kinase counterscreening data and applied prospectively to uncover kinase activities in marketed drugs. In addition, the role of discriminating fragments in kinase recognition was interrogated using available structural data, providing an insight into their effect on inhibitor potency and selectivity.

   Abstract={A simple approach to evaluate logical pharmacophores on the base of topological features is described. It is based on considerations of the relative frequencies of structural features within different classes of activity. Shannon's entropy is used in the case of more than two classes. To obtain a pharmacophore a stepwise interactive procedure is performed. The algorithm is applied to fungicidal carboxamides and beta-adrenergic phenethylamine agonists and antagonists. In both cases meaningful pharmacophores could be obtained.}

   Abstract={Virtual screening and high-throughput screening are two major components of lead discovery within the pharmaceutical industry. In this paper we describe improvements to previously published methods for similarity searching with reduced graphs, with a particular focus on ligand-based virtual screening, and describe a novel use of reduced graphs in the clustering of high-throughput screening data. Literature methods for reduced graph similarity searching encode the reduced graphs as binary fingerprints, which has a number of issues. In this paper we extend the definition of the reduced graph to include positively and negatively ionizable groups and introduce a new method for measuring the similarity of reduced graphs based on a weighted edit distance. Moving beyond simple similarity searching, we show how more flexible queries can be built using reduced graphs and describe a database system that allows iterative querying with multiple representations. Reduced graphs capture many important features of ligand-receptor interactions and, in conjunction with other whole molecule descriptors, provide an informative way to review HTS data. We describe a novel use of reduced graphs in this context, introducing a method we have termed data-driven clustering, that identifies clusters of molecules represented by a particular whole molecule descriptor and enriched in active compounds.}
